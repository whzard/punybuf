# Punybuf
Punybuf is a strongly typed data serialization format. [Read more about it here](https://github.com/whzard/punybuf).

This crate implements the `common` types in punybuf, so that the generated code can link to this crate.

*This isn't yet 1.0 - the API isn't fully realized yet and this crate may contain bugs*
